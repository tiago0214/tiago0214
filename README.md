# **Tiago Souza Dias**
My journey began in Law, but each day I felt more drawn to the countless possibilities that surround the world of technology. I decided to take this leap and dedicate myself entirely to software development.

Currently, I have been immersing myself in the world of programming, exploring everything from web development with JavaScript frameworks to desktop development with C#, as well as deeper concepts such as network protocols, operating systems, and computer architecture.

I work as a full-stack developer, specializing in backend languages like TypeScript/Node.js and C#, as well as frontend development with React. I am also pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at Uninter.
